<center><h2>Computer engineering combines electrical engineering and computer science to focus on the design 
and implementation of computer systems (logic devices and software). It is generally part of the engineering department at a university and requires a strong background in math. Read on to find out what computer engineering students study and where they can work.</h2></center>


<center><h1>Computer Engineering Career Information</h1><center>

<center><h2>Computer engineering involves the design of computer systems (hardware and software) and related devices. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. The electrical engineering aspect of the discipline includes designing application devices, interface hardware, memories, and computer chips. The computer science component involves software engineering, programming, operating systems, algorithms and data structures.</h2><center>

<center><h1>Embedded Systems</h1><center>

<center><h2>An important aspect of computer engineering is 'embedded systems,' which is computer software and hardware designed for a specific device. For example, digital alarm systems, video recorders and audio players as well as cell phones are the results of computer engineering in the area of embedded systems. Most of the software design involves interfacing the device with another device or with a user.</h2></center>


<center><h1>Networking</h1><center>

<center><h2>Computer engineering involves building networks, both WAN (wide area networks) and LAN (local area networks). Other areas that a computer engineer may work in include mobile and wireless technology, telephony communications and integrated services.</h2><center>
