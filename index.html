<center><h2>Computer engineering combines electrical engineering and computer science to focus on the design 
and implementation of computer systems (logic devices and software). It is generally part of the engineering department at a university and requires a strong background in math. Read on to find out what computer engineering students study and where they can work.</h2></center>


<center><h1>Computer Engineering Career Information</h1><center>

<center><h2>Computer engineering involves the design of computer systems (hardware and software) and related devices. It uses the techniques and principles of electrical engineering and computer science, but also covers areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), robotics, computer networks, computer architecture and operating systems. The electrical engineering aspect of the discipline includes designing application devices, interface hardware, memories, and computer chips. The computer science component involves software engineering, programming, operating systems, algorithms and data structures.</h2><center>

<center><h1>Embedded Systems</h1><center>

<center><h2>An important aspect of computer engineering is 'embedded systems,' which is computer software and hardware designed for a specific device. For example, digital alarm systems, video recorders and audio players as well as cell phones are the results of computer engineering in the area of embedded systems. Most of the software design involves interfacing the device with another device or with a user.</h2></center>


<center><h1>Networking</h1><center>

<center><h2>Computer engineering involves building networks, both WAN (wide area networks) and LAN (local area networks). Other areas that a computer engineer may work in include mobile and wireless technology, telephony communications and integrated services.</h2><center>

<center><h1>Multimedia</h1><center>

<center><h2>This area involves processing of multimedia information. Computer engineering looks into support for multimedia libraries and databases and retrieval of information.</h2><center>

<center><h1>UChicago researchers launch projects exploring health disparities, machine learning</h1></center>

<center><h2>The COVID-19 pandemic has mobilized the world’s scientific community like no other recent crisis, including many researchers using the most modern data science and artificial intelligence approaches. At the University of Chicago, public health experts, computer scientists, economists and policy analysts have launched projects using computational tools to better detect, diagnose, treat and prevent the spread of the deadly virus.</h2></center>


<center><h2>This summer, three of these projects received seed funding from the C3.ai Digital Transformation Institute (DTI), a new partnership of technology companies and universities committed to accelerating the benefits of artificial intelligence for business, government and society. The research attacks the pandemic from several angles: helping policymakers control disease spread by identifying and addressing key social factors, physicians detect the disease at earlier stages, and hospitals decide which patients require admission. A fourth project, a collaboration led by UChicago Medicine’s Maryellen Giger, was funded by the organization in spring.</h2></center>

<center><h2>The awards were part of $5.4 million in funding distributed by DTI, after their inaugural call for proposals in March. The group also provides AI software tools and a “data lake” of COVID-19 datasets to aid researchers studying the pandemic.</h2></center>

<center><h2>“The enthusiastic response among scientists and researchers coupled with the diverse, high-quality and compelling proposals we’ve received suggests that we have the potential to alter the course of this global pandemic,” said Thomas M. Siebel, CEO of C3.ai. “In the face of this crisis, the Institute is proud to bring together the best and brightest minds and provide direction and leadership to support objective analysis and AI-based, data-driven science to mitigate COVID-19.”</h2></center>
